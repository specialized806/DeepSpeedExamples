# OPSD HybridEngine rollout benchmark

`benchmark_hybrid_engine_rollout.py` measures rollout-level performance for an
OPSD workload backed by DeepSpeed HybridEngine. It runs a matrix of synthetic,
exact-length prompts and reports prompt expansion, generation, post-processing,
total latency, generated-token throughput, and peak accelerator memory. Each
case includes raw iteration profiles, mean and p50 summaries, and p95 summaries
for latency metrics.

This benchmark depends on the rollout profiling API introduced by
DeepSpeed PR #8295:

https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed/pull/8295

Use a DeepSpeed checkout that contains that API and place it first on
`PYTHONPATH`. The current validation scope is one process, one GPU, and ZeRO-0.
This is a HybridEngine rollout benchmark, not a complete OPSD training-step
benchmark; it does not measure teacher inference, loss computation, backward,
or optimizer work.

## Usage

The workload matrix is controlled by `--batch-sizes`,
`--samples-per-prompt`, `--prompt-lengths`, and `--response-lengths`. Both
`--dtype fp16` and `--dtype bf16` are supported. `--warmup` and `--iterations`
control unreported warmup calls and recorded calls. Pass
`--release-inference-cache` to release the inference cache after generation;
otherwise the benchmark retains it. `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--seed`, and
`--output` control sampling, reproducibility, and the JSON output path.

The largest effective batch (`batch_size * samples_per_prompt`) executes first
so HybridEngine initializes a sufficiently large inference workspace. Results
in the output JSON retain the matrix order requested on the command line.

From the DeepSpeedExamples repository root, run a single-GPU benchmark with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/workspace/DeepSpeed_woo:/workspace/DeepSpeedExamples \
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 \
  benchmarks/opsd/benchmark_hybrid_engine_rollout.py \
  --model facebook/opt-6.7b \
  --batch-sizes 1 \
  --samples-per-prompt 1 4 \
  --prompt-lengths 128 512 \
  --response-lengths 32 128 \
  --warmup 1 \
  --iterations 2 \
  --output /tmp/opsd_rollout_profile_examples.json
```

Use `--help` for the complete argument list. Model download, GPU memory, and
the fused inference kernels supported by the selected model can limit which
matrix shapes run successfully.
